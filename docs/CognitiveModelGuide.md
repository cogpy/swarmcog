# SwarmCog Cognitive Model Guide

## Introduction

SwarmCog implements a sophisticated cognitive architecture inspired by cognitive science principles and OpenCog's cognitive framework. This guide explains the theoretical foundations, design rationale, and practical applications of SwarmCog's two core cognitive components:

1. **The 7-Phase Cognitive Cycle** - A comprehensive cognitive processing pipeline
2. **The 3 Processing Modes** - Different execution strategies for cognitive operations

## Theoretical Foundations

### Cognitive Science Origins

SwarmCog's cognitive model is grounded in several key cognitive science theories:

**1. Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**
- Developed by Bernard Baars, GWT proposes that consciousness arises from a global workspace where different cognitive processes compete for attention
- SwarmCog's attention phase implements this by selecting which atoms/information to focus on

**2. ACT-R Cognitive Architecture**
- John Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) provides the foundation for goal-driven cognitive processing
- SwarmCog adopts ACT-R's cycle of perception, cognition, and action

**3. SOAR Architecture**
- Allen Newell's SOAR (State, Operator, And Result) emphasizes learning and problem-solving
- SwarmCog incorporates SOAR's emphasis on continuous learning and adaptation

**4. OpenCog Framework**
- Ben Goertzel's OpenCog provides the AtomSpace knowledge representation
- SwarmCog extends OpenCog's concepts for multi-agent coordination

### Multi-Agent Systems Theory

SwarmCog integrates cognitive architectures with multi-agent systems (MAS) theory:

- **Distributed Cognition**: Cognitive processes span multiple agents
- **Social Cognition**: Agents model and reason about other agents
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Complex behaviors emerge from agent interactions
- **Trust Networks**: Dynamic relationship building based on interaction history

## The 7-Phase Cognitive Cycle

### Overview

The cognitive cycle represents a complete loop of autonomous cognitive processing. Each phase serves a specific cognitive function and builds upon the previous phases to enable sophisticated reasoning and coordination.

```
Perception → Attention → Reasoning → Planning → Execution → Learning → Reflection → [Loop]
```

### Phase 1: Perception

**Purpose**: Gather information from the environment and other agents

**Origins**: Based on cognitive psychology's understanding of sensory processing and environmental awareness

**Implementation**:
```python
class PerceptionProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        # Update beliefs based on agentspace observations
        agent_nodes = agentspace.get_agents()
        state.beliefs["visible_agents"] = [node.name for node in agent_nodes 
                                         if node.name != state.agent_id]
        
        # Detect environmental changes
        recent_atoms = [atom for atom in agentspace.atoms.values() 
                       if time.time() - atom.timestamp < 60]
        state.beliefs["recent_changes"] = len(recent_atoms)
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Environmental Awareness**: Agents must understand their context
- **Social Perception**: Detecting other agents and their activities  
- **Change Detection**: Identifying relevant environmental modifications
- **Information Gathering**: Collecting data for subsequent cognitive processes

**Real-World Example**: 
A research agent perceives that two new agents have joined the system, there's been increased collaboration activity (10 new atoms in the last minute), and a new research goal has been posted.

### Phase 2: Attention

**Purpose**: Select what to focus cognitive resources on

**Origins**: Inspired by attention theory in cognitive psychology and Global Workspace Theory

**Implementation**:
```python
class AttentionProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        # Get most important atoms based on attention values
        important_atoms = agentspace.get_most_important_atoms(limit=5)
        state.attention_focus = [atom.id for atom in important_atoms]
        
        # Boost attention for goal-related atoms
        for goal in state.goals:
            goal_atoms = agentspace.find_atoms(name=goal)
            for atom in goal_atoms[:2]:  # Top 2 goal-related atoms
                if atom.id not in state.attention_focus:
                    state.attention_focus.append(atom.id)
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Resource Allocation**: Cognitive resources are limited and must be allocated efficiently
- **Priority Management**: Focus on the most important information
- **Goal Alignment**: Prioritize information relevant to current goals
- **Attention Competition**: Multiple stimuli compete for cognitive focus

**Real-World Example**:
The agent focuses attention on: (1) a high-priority collaboration request, (2) atoms related to its current "machine learning research" goal, (3) a trust relationship that needs updating.

### Phase 3: Reasoning

**Purpose**: Make inferences and update beliefs

**Origins**: Based on symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation in AI

**Implementation**:
```python
class ReasoningProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        # Simple reasoning: infer collaboration opportunities
        if agent_node:
            collaborators = agentspace.get_collaborators(agent_node)
            state.beliefs["potential_collaborators"] = [c.name for c in collaborators]
            
            # Reason about trust relationships
            trust_levels = {}
            for collab in collaborators:
                trust = agentspace.get_trust_level(agent_node, collab)
                if trust is not None:
                    trust_levels[collab.name] = trust
            state.beliefs["trust_levels"] = trust_levels
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Inference Making**: Draw logical conclusions from available information
- **Belief Updates**: Maintain consistent and current belief systems
- **Relationship Reasoning**: Understand social dynamics and trust networks
- **Causal Understanding**: Identify cause-effect relationships

**Real-World Example**:
The agent reasons that Alice (trust level 0.8) and Bob (trust level 0.6) are potential collaborators for a machine learning project, and infers that Alice is more reliable based on past interactions.

### Phase 4: Planning

**Purpose**: Create action plans for achieving goals

**Origins**: Derived from AI planning and goal decomposition techniques

**Implementation**:
```python
class PlanningProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        # Simple planning: decompose goals into intentions
        new_intentions = []
        for goal in state.goals:
            if "collaborate" in goal.lower():
                new_intentions.extend([
                    f"find_collaborator_for_{goal}",
                    f"establish_trust_for_{goal}",
                    f"coordinate_action_for_{goal}"
                ])
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Goal Decomposition**: Break complex goals into manageable sub-tasks
- **Action Sequencing**: Determine the order of actions needed
- **Resource Planning**: Consider available capabilities and constraints
- **Collaboration Planning**: Coordinate with other agents

**Real-World Example**:
For the goal "develop_ml_model", the agent creates intentions: "find_data_scientist_collaborator", "establish_trust_with_data_expert", "coordinate_model_development".

### Phase 5: Execution

**Purpose**: Carry out planned actions and coordinate with others

**Origins**: Based on motor control and action execution in cognitive science

**Implementation**:
```python
class ExecutionProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        executed_intentions = []
        for intention in state.intentions[:3]:  # Execute top 3 intentions
            if "find_collaborator" in intention:
                # Look for potential collaborators in agentspace
                if other_agents:
                    target_agent = other_agents[0]
                    agentspace.add_collaboration_link(agent_node, target_agent, "cognitive_task")
                    executed_intentions.append(intention)
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Action Implementation**: Transform plans into concrete actions
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Execute collaborative behaviors
- **Environmental Interaction**: Modify the shared environment (AgentSpace)
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjust execution based on dynamic conditions

**Real-World Example**:
The agent executes "find_collaborator" by creating a collaboration link with DataScientist_Agent and establishes initial trust level of 0.7.

### Phase 6: Learning

**Purpose**: Update knowledge based on experiences

**Origins**: Rooted in machine learning and cognitive theories of adaptation

**Implementation**:
```python
class LearningProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        # Learn from collaboration outcomes
        for key, value in state.beliefs.items():
            if key.startswith("collaborated_with_") and value:
                # Create memory node for this collaboration
                memory_node = Node(AtomType.MEMORY_NODE, f"collaboration_memory_{agent_name}")
                agentspace.add_atom(memory_node)
                
                # Increase trust if collaboration was successful
                if current_trust is not None and current_trust < 0.9:
                    new_trust = min(0.95, current_trust + 0.1)
                    agentspace.add_trust_relationship(agent_node, partner_node, new_trust)
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Experience Integration**: Incorporate new experiences into knowledge base
- **Skill Development**: Improve capabilities through practice
- **Relationship Learning**: Update trust and collaboration models
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Modify future behavior based on outcomes

**Real-World Example**:
After successfully collaborating with DataScientist_Agent on a project, the agent increases its trust in that agent from 0.7 to 0.8 and creates a positive collaboration memory.

### Phase 7: Reflection

**Purpose**: Evaluate performance and adapt behavior

**Origins**: Based on metacognition and self-regulation in psychology

**Implementation**:
```python
class ReflectionProcessor(CognitiveProcessor):
    async def process(self, state: CognitiveState, agentspace: AgentSpace):
        # Reflect on goal achievement
        achieved_goals = []
        for goal in state.goals:
            goal_beliefs = [k for k in state.beliefs.keys() if goal.lower() in k.lower()]
            if len(goal_beliefs) > 0:
                achieved_goals.append(goal)
        
        # Remove achieved goals
        state.goals = [g for g in state.goals if g not in achieved_goals]
        
        # Adapt activation level based on recent activity
        if recent_activities > 3:
            state.activation_level = min(1.0, state.activation_level + 0.1)
```

**Why This Phase Matters**:
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of recent actions
- **Goal Management**: Remove completed goals and identify new ones
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: Adjust cognitive parameters and strategies
- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Develop understanding of own cognitive processes

**Real-World Example**:
The agent reflects that it successfully completed the "establish_collaboration" goal (removes it from goal list), had high activity (increases activation level), and should focus more on knowledge sharing in future collaborations.

## The 3 Processing Modes

### 1. Synchronous Mode

**Purpose**: Sequential processing for predictable behavior

**Origins**: Traditional procedural programming and deterministic systems

**Characteristics**:
- **Sequential Execution**: Each cognitive phase completes before the next begins
- **Predictable Timing**: Consistent and measurable processing times

**Use Cases**:
- **Testing and Debugging**: Reproducible behavior for validation
- **Critical Systems**: Where predictability is essential
- **Simple Scenarios**: Single-agent or low-complexity environments
- **Educational Purposes**: Easier to understand and trace execution

**Implementation**:
```python
microkernel = CognitiveMicrokernel(agentspace, ProcessingMode.SYNCHRONOUS)
# Each phase waits for completion before proceeding
await microkernel.process_cognitive_cycle(agent_id)
```

### 2. Asynchronous Mode

**Purpose**: Concurrent processing for responsiveness

**Origins**: Modern concurrent programming and reactive systems

**Characteristics**:
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple agents can process simultaneously

**Use Cases**:
- **Real-Time Systems**: Where quick response times are critical
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Dynamic Environments**: Rapidly changing conditions
- **Interactive Applications**: User-facing systems requiring responsiveness

**Implementation**:
```python
microkernel = CognitiveMicrokernel(agentspace, ProcessingMode.ASYNCHRONOUS)
# Multiple agents process concurrently
await microkernel.start_all_agents(cycle_interval=1.0)
```

### 3. Distributed Mode

**Purpose**: Multi-node processing for scalability

**Origins**: Distributed systems and cloud computing paradigms

**Characteristics**:
- **Multi-Node Processing**: Cognitive cycles run across multiple machines

- **Research Platforms**: Large-scale cognitive experiments

**Implementation**:
```python
# Future implementation - distributed processing across nodes
microkernel = CognitiveMicrokernel(agentspace, ProcessingMode.DISTRIBUTED)
# Cognitive processing distributed across cluster nodes
```

## Integration with AgentSpace

### Knowledge Representation

The cognitive cycle operates on SwarmCog's **AgentSpace**, a knowledge representation system inspired by OpenCog's AtomSpace:

**Atom Types**:
- `AGENT_NODE`: Represents individual agents
- `CAPABILITY_NODE`: Agent skills and abilities  
- `GOAL_NODE`: Agent objectives and intentions
- `BELIEF_NODE`: Agent beliefs about world state
- `MEMORY_NODE`: Episodic memories and experiences
- `COLLABORATION_LINK`: Agent collaboration relationships
- `TRUST_LINK`: Trust relationships between agents
- `KNOWLEDGE_LINK`: Knowledge sharing connections

**Attention Values**: Each atom has Short-Term Importance (STI) and Long-Term Importance (LTI) that guide cognitive focus.

**Truth Values**: Probabilistic truth values (strength, confidence) handle uncertainty in agent beliefs.

### Multi-Agent Coordination

The cognitive cycle enables sophisticated multi-agent coordination through:

1. **Shared Knowledge Space**: All agents operate on the same AgentSpace
2. **Social Awareness**: Perception phase detects other agents and their activities
3. **Trust Networks**: Dynamic trust relationships influence collaboration decisions
4. **Emergent Behavior**: Complex group behaviors emerge from individual cognitive cycles

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Research Team Formation

**Scenario**: Dr. Alice (research lead) needs to form a team for an AI safety project.

**Cognitive Cycle Execution**:

1. **Perception**: Alice perceives 5 available researchers in the AgentSpace
2. **Attention**: Focuses on researchers with AI safety expertise
3. **Reasoning**: Infers Dr. Bob (ML expert, trust=0.8) and Dr. Carol (ethics expert, trust=0.7) are optimal collaborators
4. **Planning**: Creates intentions to contact Bob and Carol, propose collaboration
5. **Execution**: Sends collaboration proposals, establishes project workspace
6. **Learning**: Updates collaboration success metrics based on responses
7. **Reflection**: Evaluates team formation strategy, adjusts future approach

### Example 2: Knowledge Sharing Network

**Scenario**: A breakthrough in quantum computing needs to be shared across the research network.

**Multi-Agent Cognitive Processing**:

- **Dr. Quantum** (discoverer): Shares quantum breakthrough knowledge
- **Information Agents**: Perceive new knowledge, reason about relevance to their domains  
- **Research Agents**: Plan how to integrate quantum insights into their projects
- **Coordination Agents**: Execute knowledge distribution strategy

**Processing Mode Impact**:
- **Synchronous**: Knowledge spreads sequentially, predictable but slower
- **Asynchronous**: Rapid concurrent processing, faster knowledge propagation
- **Distributed**: Scales to large research networks across institutions

### Example 3: Dynamic Trust Evolution

**Scenario**: Agents learning to trust each other through repeated interactions.

**Trust Learning Cycle**:
1. **Initial Contact**: Low trust (0.3) based on reputation
2. **Successful Collaboration**: Trust increases to 0.6 after positive experience
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Further trust increase to 0.8 through information exchange
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Trust maintained despite minor disagreement
5. **Long-term Partnership**: Trust stabilizes at high level (0.9)
