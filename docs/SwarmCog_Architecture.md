# SwarmCog: Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

## Overview

SwarmCog is an OpenCog-inspired autonomous multi-agent orchestration framework that implements cognitive AI principles for intelligent agent coordination. It extends the original Swarm framework with advanced cognitive capabilities, enabling agents to reason autonomously, build trust relationships, share knowledge, and coordinate complex multi-agent tasks.

## Key Components

### 1. AgentSpace (Agentic AtomSpace)

The AgentSpace is a knowledge representation system inspired by OpenCog's AtomSpace, specifically designed for multi-agent cognitive processing.

**Core Features:**
- **Atoms**: Basic units of knowledge representation
  - **Nodes**: Represent entities (agents, capabilities, goals, beliefs, memories)
  - **Links**: Represent relationships between entities (collaboration, trust, knowledge)
- **Truth Values**: Represent certainty and confidence of knowledge
- **Attention Values**: Manage cognitive focus and importance
- **Type System**: Hierarchical categorization of knowledge atoms

**Atom Types:**
```python
# Basic Types
NODE = "Node"
LINK = "Link"

# Agent-Specific Types
AGENT_NODE = "AgentNode"           # Represents agents in the system
CAPABILITY_NODE = "CapabilityNode" # Agent capabilities/skills
GOAL_NODE = "GoalNode"             # Agent goals and objectives
BELIEF_NODE = "BeliefNode"         # Agent beliefs about world state
MEMORY_NODE = "MemoryNode"         # Agent episodic memories

# Relationship Types
COLLABORATION_LINK = "CollaborationLink" # Agent collaboration relationships
DELEGATION_LINK = "DelegationLink"       # Task delegation relationships
TRUST_LINK = "TrustLink"                 # Trust relationships between agents
KNOWLEDGE_LINK = "KnowledgeLink"         # Knowledge sharing relationships
EVALUATION_LINK = "EvaluationLink"       # Performance evaluations
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
from swarm import AgentSpace, AtomType

# Create AgentSpace
agentspace = AgentSpace("research_lab")

# Add agents with capabilities
alice = agentspace.add_agent_node("Alice", ["reasoning", "planning"])
bob = agentspace.add_agent_node("Bob", ["data_analysis", "ml"])

# Create collaboration link
collab = agentspace.add_collaboration_link(alice, bob, "research_project")

# Add trust relationship
trust = agentspace.add_trust_relationship(alice, bob, 0.8)
```

### 2. Cognitive Microkernel

The Cognitive Microkernel implements the core cognitive processing system that enables autonomous multi-agent coordination.

**Cognitive Cycle Phases:**
1. **Perception**: Gather information from environment and other agents
2. **Attention**: Select what to focus cognitive resources on
3. **Reasoning**: Make inferences and update beliefs
4. **Planning**: Create action plans for achieving goals
5. **Execution**: Carry out planned actions and coordinate with others
6. **Learning**: Update knowledge based on experiences
7. **Reflection**: Evaluate performance and adapt behavior

> **ðŸ“– Detailed Explanation**: For comprehensive information about the theoretical foundations, origins, and practical applications of the cognitive cycle and processing modes, see the [Cognitive Model Guide](CognitiveModelGuide.md).

**Processing Modes:**
- **Synchronous**: Sequential processing for predictable behavior
- **Asynchronous**: Concurrent processing for responsiveness  
- **Distributed**: Multi-node processing for scalability

**Usage Example:**
```python
from swarm import CognitiveMicrokernel, ProcessingMode, AgentSpace

# Create microkernel
agentspace = AgentSpace("cognitive_lab")
microkernel = CognitiveMicrokernel(agentspace, ProcessingMode.ASYNCHRONOUS)

# Add cognitive agent
state = microkernel.add_cognitive_agent(
    "researcher",
    goals=["solve_complex_problem"],
    initial_beliefs={"domain": "AI_research"}
)

# Start autonomous processing
await microkernel.start_all_agents(cycle_interval=1.0)
```

### 3. Cognitive Agents

Cognitive Agents are enhanced agents with autonomous reasoning, learning, and coordination capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Autonomous Reasoning**: Independent goal decomposition and planning
- **Trust Management**: Dynamic trust relationship building
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Collaborative learning and information exchange  
- **Memory Systems**: Episodic memory for experience-based learning
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Performance reflection and behavioral adaptation

**Cognitive Functions:**
- `perceive_environment()`: Environmental and social perception
- `reason_about_goals()`: Goal analysis and feasibility assessment
- `plan_collaboration()`: Collaboration strategy development
- `find_collaborators()`: Partner discovery based on capabilities/trust
- `establish_trust()`: Trust relationship management
- `share_knowledge()`: Information and insight sharing
- `coordinate_with_agent()`: Direct agent coordination
- `learn_from_experience()`: Experience-based knowledge updates
- `reflect_on_performance()`: Self-evaluation and adaptation

**Usage Example:**
```python
from swarm import CognitiveAgent

# Create cognitive agent
agent = CognitiveAgent(
    name="Dr_Alice",
    capabilities=["project_management", "strategic_planning"],
    goals=["coordinate_research_team", "deliver_results"],
    initial_beliefs={"role": "team_leader", "domain": "AI_research"}
)

# Add capabilities and goals dynamically
agent.add_capability("conflict_resolution", "Resolve team conflicts", 0.8)
agent.add_goal("improve_team_performance", 0.9)

# Establish trust and coordinate
trust_result = agent.establish_trust("Dr_Bob", 0.8)
coordination = agent.coordinate_with_agent("Dr_Bob", "joint_research")
```

### 4. SwarmCog Orchestrator

The main SwarmCog system coordinates cognitive agents using AgentSpace and Cognitive Microkernel.

**Key Features:**
- **Agent Management**: Create, configure, and manage cognitive agents
- **Task Coordination**: Multi-agent task orchestration and assignment
- **Topology Analysis**: Network analysis of agent relationships
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time system state and performance tracking
- **Autonomous Simulation**: Hands-off autonomous behavior execution

**Usage Example:**

swarmcog = create_swarmcog(
    agentspace_name="research_lab",
    processing_mode=ProcessingMode.ASYNCHRONOUS,
    max_agents=20
)

# Create research team
lead = swarmcog.create_cognitive_agent(
    "Dr_Alice", 
    capabilities=["leadership", "coordination"],
    goals=["manage_research_project"]
